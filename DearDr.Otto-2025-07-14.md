Dear Dr. Otto,

Thank you again for your care and support. Here’s my wellness update for today’s visit, offering a full picture of where I’ve been this past month:


---

✴️ Symptom Summary

Fatigue has been more pronounced—this isn’t sleepiness, but a deep depletion of energy reserves.

My activity level has decreased significantly. For the past month, I’ve been limited to only essential household chores, such as preparing meals, cleaning, taking showers, and other basic tasks.

I’ve had more frequent lightheadedness and occasional mild chest pain.

I’ve experienced two recent falls.

Despite these challenges, I feel more emotionally peaceful overall.


---

💊 Medication

Over the past month, I’ve been taking half of my normal medication dosage.

Nighttime: I’ve switched back to Benadryl instead of hydroxyzine.

For anxiety and sleep support, I’m primarily using lorazepam now rather than clonazepam.



---

🐾 Supportive Measures

My therapy pet continues to offer meaningful emotional support and grounding.

I’ve re-established a daily contemplative prayer practice (20 minutes each morning), which contributes to a greater sense of spiritual and emotional balance.



---

🏋️ Gentle Movement

I’ve begun a light strength training routine with a 5 lb dumbbell—about 10 minutes per day.

Movements are paced carefully to avoid triggering post-exertional malaise (PEM).



---

🍽️ Nutrition & Hydration

I’m following a modified ketogenic diet:

~75g fat, 100g protein, and ~1800 calories daily

Blood ketone levels have stabilized around 0.7 mmol/L over the past three weeks

I’ve introduced intermittent fasting, from 6:00 p.m. to around 10:00–11:00 a.m.


I aim for 3 quarts of water daily, adjusting based on symptoms and output.



---

🌙 Sleep & Rest

I’ve been more consistent with sleep hygiene:

I begin winding down around 4:00–5:00 p.m.

I use CPAP with oxygen, soft music (Stephen Halpern), melatonin, and occasional lorazepam

The focus is on shifting gently into parasympathetic rest in the evening




---

⚠️ Pacing & Activity Zone

I remain in the YELLOW zone for pacing:

No green-zone activity at this time

Continuing caution with physical exertion due to heightened PEM risk




---

✨ Final Notes

Although my physical energy remains low, I’ve been able to cultivate greater emotional and spiritual peace. With support from tools like the ME/CFS Wellness Companion I’ve been building, I’m continuing to refine my daily rhythms and health practices.

Dear Dr. Otto,

Over the past month, I’ve been experiencing more pronounced fatigue—not so much sleepiness, but a deep lack of physical energy. I’ve also felt more light-headed, and have had two mild falls. There’s been occasional mild chest discomfort, but nothing alarming. Overall, I’ve been less active and mostly limited to essential household activities—like preparing meals, light cleaning, and taking showers. Despite all this, I’d say my emotional state has been more peaceful.

One bright spot has been my therapy pet, who continues to be a great source of comfort and motivation.

In terms of movement, I’ve gently started using a five-pound dumbbell for about 10 minutes a day, always being careful not to trigger PEM.

Nutritionally, I’m back on a keto-style diet—low-fat, low-protein—aiming for 75 grams of fat, 100 grams of protein, and around 1800 calories a day. I’ve been testing positive for ketosis for the last three weeks, with ketones around 0.7. I’ve also begun intermittent fasting, generally from 6 p.m. until about 10 or 11 the next morning. I’m doing my best to stay hydrated, with a target of three quarts of water per day.

For medications, I’ve been taking half of my usual dosage overall. I’ve switched back to Benadryl at night instead of hydroxyzine, and I’m mostly using lorazepam rather than clonazepam.

Sleep hygiene has been a focus too. I try to begin winding down around 4 or 5 in the afternoon—dimming lights, calming music, and preparing mentally and physically for rest. And each morning, I’ve been practicing contemplative prayer for about 20 minutes to start the day.

As always, thank you for your support and care.
