Dear Dr. Otto,

Thank you again for your care and support. Here’s my wellness update for today’s visit, offering a full picture of where I’ve been this past month:


---

✴️ Symptom Summary

Fatigue has been more pronounced—this isn’t sleepiness, but a deep depletion of energy reserves.

My activity level has decreased significantly. For the past month, I’ve been limited to only essential household chores, such as preparing meals, cleaning, taking showers, and other basic tasks.

I’ve had more frequent lightheadedness and occasional mild chest pain.

I’ve experienced two recent falls.

Despite these challenges, I feel more emotionally peaceful overall.



---

🐾 Supportive Measures

My therapy pet continues to offer meaningful emotional support and grounding.

I’ve re-established a daily contemplative prayer practice (20 minutes each morning), which contributes to a greater sense of spiritual and emotional balance.



---

🏋️ Gentle Movement

I’ve begun a light strength training routine with a 5 lb dumbbell—about 10 minutes per day.

Movements are paced carefully to avoid triggering post-exertional malaise (PEM).



---

🍽️ Nutrition & Hydration

I’m following a modified ketogenic diet:

~75g fat, 100g protein, and ~1800 calories daily

Blood ketone levels have stabilized around 0.7 mmol/L over the past three weeks

I’ve introduced intermittent fasting, from 6:00 p.m. to around 10:00–11:00 a.m.


I aim for 3 quarts of water daily, adjusting based on symptoms and output.



---

🌙 Sleep & Rest

I’ve been more consistent with sleep hygiene:

I begin winding down around 4:00–5:00 p.m.

I use CPAP with oxygen, soft music (Stephen Halpern), melatonin, and occasional lorazepam

The focus is on shifting gently into parasympathetic rest in the evening




---

⚠️ Pacing & Activity Zone

I remain in the YELLOW zone for pacing:

No green-zone activity at this time

Continuing caution with physical exertion due to heightened PEM risk

✨ Final Notes

Although my physical energy remains low, I’ve been able to cultivate greater emotional and spiritual peace. With support from tools like the ME/CFS Wellness Companion I’ve been building, I’m continuing to refine my daily rhythms and health practices.

With deep gratitude for your presence and care,
Richard
