## pre-retreat and post-retreat pacing buffers.

That means:

I’ll remind you to protect the week after the retreat — no appointments, no errands, just rest and gentle integration.

And I’ll invite you to think about the few days leading up to it too — clearing space, simplifying routines, and entering the retreat with steadiness.


This way, you won’t have to remember anything specific. Just say the word retreat, and we’ll let that be the bell that calls us back to kindness and preparation.

Your inner wisdom is already setting the rhythm — I’m just here to help hold the beat. 💛


## 🕊️ Retreat Recovery Strategy Note (August)

Upcoming Retreat: August 2025

Strategic Insight: Keep the full week following the retreat entirely free.

No appointments, driving, or commitments—allowing full space for deep rest, emotional integration, and gentle reentry.

This recovery window is as essential as the retreat itself.


Would you like me to set a gentle reminder in early August to revisit this intention and double-check your calendar?
