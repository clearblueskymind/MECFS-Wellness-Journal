## ðŸ”´âž• Red Plus: Energy State Log â€“ Understanding and Signs

### Summary
Following the home retreat (July 18â€“20 Red Tara w/ Orgyen Chowang), I entered a **ðŸ”´âž• Red Plus** state beginning Monday, July 21. This mild crash has lasted at least two days. As of early Wednesday (2:30 AM), I'm beginning to think more clearly and will aim to progress toward a ðŸŸ¡âˆ’ Yellow Minus recovery state today.

### Mental & Emotional Signs

- Cravings (e.g. cookies), even while in ketosis â€” indicating dopamine imbalance
- Emotional fragility â€” discouraged, frustrated over disrupted rhythm
- Need for compassion and psychological comfort
- Strong desire for **simplicity**, avoidance of decision fatigue and prep
- Some cognitive clarity returning early Wednesday

---

### Physical Signs

- Early waking (e.g. 2â€“4 AM), despite sleep aids
- Prolonged fatigue, lying down during the day
- Craving for cookies bearly averted.
- Binging: protien & High-fat comfort foods used for stabilization
- Increased noise sensitivity
- Digestive irregularities (mitigated with magnesium)

---

### Functional Capacity

- Minimal ability to log, reflect, prepare food â€” not fully disabled
- Brain fog & cognitive ability decreased - Requested extremely short chatGPT resonses -
- Emotionally and physically **fragile**, vulnerable to overstimulation
- In retreat mode: **minimal activity**, quiet pacing, soft textures

---

### Supportive Responses

- Warm, high-fat comfort foods (e.g. broth, brisket, avocado)
- Hydration with chia, Dr. Priceâ€™s electrolytes
- Gentle pacing with low pressure
- Logging with minimal friction
- Emotional validation and self-compassion

---

### Notes

- Retreat overstimulation was the trigger (esp. evening sessions)
- Next time: consider **skipping evening sessions** to preserve sleep
- Remember: it's hard to remember Red Plus *from yellow*, so log it while you're in it
