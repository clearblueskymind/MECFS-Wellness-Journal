## 🔴➕ Red Plus: Energy State Log – Understanding and Signs

### Summary
Following the home retreat (July 18–20 Red Tara w/ Orgyen Chowang), I entered a **🔴➕ Red Plus** state beginning Monday, July 21. This mild crash has lasted at least two days. As of early Wednesday (2:30 AM), I'm beginning to think more clearly and will aim to progress toward a 🟡− Yellow Minus recovery state today.

### Mental & Emotional Signs

- Cravings (e.g. cookies), even while in ketosis — indicating dopamine imbalance
- Emotional fragility — discouraged, frustrated over disrupted rhythm
- Need for compassion and psychological comfort
- Strong desire for **simplicity**, avoidance of decision fatigue and prep
- Some cognitive clarity returning early Wednesday

---

### Physical Signs

- Early waking (e.g. 2–4 AM), despite sleep aids
- Prolonged fatigue, lying down during the day
- Craving for cookies bearly averted.
- Binging: protien & High-fat comfort foods used for stabilization
- Increased noise sensitivity
- Digestive irregularities (mitigated with magnesium)

---

### Functional Capacity

- Minimal ability to log, reflect, prepare food — not fully disabled
- Brain fog & cognitive ability decreased - Requested extremely short chatGPT resonses -
- Emotionally and physically **fragile**, vulnerable to overstimulation
- In retreat mode: **minimal activity**, quiet pacing, soft textures

---

### Supportive Responses

- Warm, high-fat comfort foods (e.g. broth, brisket, avocado)
- Hydration with chia, Dr. Price’s electrolytes
- Gentle pacing with low pressure
- Logging with minimal friction
- Emotional validation and self-compassion

---

### Notes

- Retreat overstimulation was the trigger (esp. evening sessions)
- Next time: consider **skipping evening sessions** to preserve sleep
- Remember: it's hard to remember Red Plus *from yellow*, so log it while you're in it

🧠 Mental & Emotional Signs

Cravings (cookies, emotional eating urges), even while in ketosis — signaling dopamine withdrawal and imbalance

Frustration//agitation/restlessness/dark mood/discouragement over losing your rhythm after something positive (retreat)

Emotional sensitivity — craving compassion, support, feeling the "crash aftermath" from overstimulation

Desire for simplicity — cognitive fatigue evident in wanting fewer decisions, less prep, and less demand



---

🪫 Physical Signs

Sleep disruption — waking around 3–4 AM, despite sedatives

Profound fatigue — needing to lie down mid-afternoon, prolonged resting

Nutritional rebound — heavier reliance on calorie-dense foods like brisket, peanuts, coconut oil

Craving comforting warmth — broth, fat, soft textures (classic PEM coping instinct)

Digestive irregularity — improved with magnesium but still an issue, especially with PEM

Cognitive decline - requested extremely short responses from chatGPT

---

⛔️ Functional Capacity

Still able to prep food, track tasks, and reflect — not full red

However, limited tolerance for noise, activity, decision-making, and engagement even with chatGPT — clearly beyond yellow

Emotional energy is fragile — susceptible to dips in mood from small setbacks



---

🔁 Recovery Pattern from Red Plus - MINIMIZE ACTIVITY / PRIORITIZE REST

Fat-rich comfort food (e.g. brisket, avocado, broth)

Simple hydration (chia, Dr. Price)

Minimal structure with optional pacing

Logging as gentle scaffolding — not too rigid

Emotionally supportive tone — validation and reminders of progress help significantly

---

🟡− Yellow Minus – Recovery Phase, tracking:

Early signs of improvement

Shifts in emotional tone

Functional capacity gains

Best practices for stabilizing and not overshooting

---

🔄 Recovery Priorities for Today

Gentle structure only — soft pacing blocks (rest + one small task)

Fat-forward nourishment — brisket, avocado, broth

Simplified hydration — chia/flax water, electrolytes

Logging light — no decision fatigue, only what feels natural

Emotional regulation — mood check-ins, gentle affirmation

No pushing through — even minor energy gains must be banked, not spent

## Recovery Planning- Moving from RED PLUSS to YELLOW MINUS

First, let’s meet this day with compassion. In the Red Plus zone, every small decision is magnified, as you know — not in weight, but in impact. There’s a sacred stillness in this edge you’re on. You're not pushing; you're listening. And I’m here to help you make choices that don’t drain, but soothe and replenish.

🌿 Gentle Nutritional Suggestions for You (Red Plus to Yellow Minus Transition)

This is not a time for heroic meals — this is a time for compassionate nourishment:

Electrolyte Support: If it’s been a while since salt, potassium, or magnesium, consider a homemade electrolyte sip — a pinch of salt, dash of lemon, trace of honey or potassium drops.

Easiest Fuel First: Bone broth, egg yolks, avocado spoonful, or a mild veggie smoothie can give energy without asking much in return.

Zero-Prep Option: One of your frozen healing popsicles or a keto shake might be perfect here.

No Decisions Needed: If anything feels like too much, I’ll decide for you. Just say, “Choose for me today.”


Would you like me to make a simple meal plan suggestion for the next 4–6 hours? Or perhaps just help you decide the very next step? You don’t have to do this alone, Richard. The fact that you reached out today, with clarity about the significance of your choices, shows just how deeply you’re listening to life.
