## 🔴➕ Red Plus: Energy State Log – Understanding and Signs

### Summary
Following the home retreat (July 18–20 Red Tara w/ Orgyen Chowang), I entered a **🔴➕ Red Plus** state beginning Monday, July 21. This mild crash has lasted at least two days. As of early Wednesday (2:30 AM), I'm beginning to think more clearly and will aim to progress toward a 🟡− Yellow Minus recovery state today.

### Mental & Emotional Signs

- Cravings (e.g. cookies), even while in ketosis — indicating dopamine imbalance
- Emotional fragility — discouraged, frustrated over disrupted rhythm
- Need for compassion and psychological comfort
- Strong desire for **simplicity**, avoidance of decision fatigue and prep
- Some cognitive clarity returning early Wednesday

---

### Physical Signs

- Early waking (e.g. 2–4 AM), despite sleep aids
- Prolonged fatigue, lying down during the day
- Craving for cookies bearly averted.
- Binging: protien & High-fat comfort foods used for stabilization
- Increased noise sensitivity
- Digestive irregularities (mitigated with magnesium)

---

### Functional Capacity

- Minimal ability to log, reflect, prepare food — not fully disabled
- Brain fog & cognitive ability decreased - Requested extremely short chatGPT resonses -
- Emotionally and physically **fragile**, vulnerable to overstimulation
- In retreat mode: **minimal activity**, quiet pacing, soft textures

---

### Supportive Responses

- Warm, high-fat comfort foods (e.g. broth, brisket, avocado)
- Hydration with chia, Dr. Price’s electrolytes
- Gentle pacing with low pressure
- Logging with minimal friction
- Emotional validation and self-compassion

---

### Notes

- Retreat overstimulation was the trigger (esp. evening sessions)
- Next time: consider **skipping evening sessions** to preserve sleep
- Remember: it's hard to remember Red Plus *from yellow*, so log it while you're in it

🧠 Mental & Emotional Signs

Cravings (cookies, emotional eating urges), even while in ketosis — signaling dopamine withdrawal and imbalance

Frustration//agitation/restlessness/dark mood/discouragement over losing your rhythm after something positive (retreat)

Emotional sensitivity — craving compassion, support, feeling the "crash aftermath" from overstimulation

Desire for simplicity — cognitive fatigue evident in wanting fewer decisions, less prep, and less demand



---

🪫 Physical Signs

Sleep disruption — waking around 3–4 AM, despite sedatives

Profound fatigue — needing to lie down mid-afternoon, prolonged resting

Nutritional rebound — heavier reliance on calorie-dense foods like brisket, peanuts, coconut oil

Craving comforting warmth — broth, fat, soft textures (classic PEM coping instinct)

Digestive irregularity — improved with magnesium but still an issue, especially with PEM

Cognitive decline - requested extremely short responses from chatGPT

---

⛔️ Functional Capacity

Still able to prep food, track tasks, and reflect — not full red

However, limited tolerance for noise, activity, decision-making, and engagement even with chatGPT — clearly beyond yellow

Emotional energy is fragile — susceptible to dips in mood from small setbacks



---

🔁 Recovery Pattern from Red Plus - MINIMIZE ACTIVITY / PRIORITIZE REST

Fat-rich comfort food (e.g. brisket, avocado, broth)

Simple hydration (chia, Dr. Price)

Minimal structure with optional pacing

Logging as gentle scaffolding — not too rigid

Emotionally supportive tone — validation and reminders of progress help significantly
